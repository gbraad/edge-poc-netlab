# Edge PoC - Virtual Networking Infrastructure

This repository contains Ansible roles and playbooks used to construct a
virtual network to be used for development and/or demonstration purposes.
These playbooks will build a virtual network on KVM and spin up two Top-Of-Rack
switches with ONIE (Open Network Install Environment).
